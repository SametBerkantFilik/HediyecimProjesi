# Node.js E-commerce
Companies nowadays are now turning their businesses online to provide their customers a better experience. One of the most popular e-commerce website we hear often is Ebay – an American multinational company running on Node.js . A lot of folks are suggesting that Node.js might be the future of web development. Node.js is a single-threaded event-driven system that runs fast even when handling lots of requests at once, it is also simple compared to traditional multi-threaded frameworks. Node.js is well suited for real-time applications: online games, collaboration tools, chat rooms, or anything where what one user (or robot?) does with the application needs to be seen by other users immediately, without a page refresh. Using a technique known as “long-polling”, you can write an application that sends updates to the user in real time.
